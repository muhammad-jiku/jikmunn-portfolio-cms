**Last Updated:** November 30, 2025

> **📋 Quick Reference:** For a concise phase-by-phase implementation guide with all 77 requirements (65 Functional + 12 Non-Functional), see [Frontend_Implementation_Phases.md](./Frontend_Implementation_Phases.md)

The following document outlines the detailed functional requirements of the **Device-Responsive Portfolio CMS** frontend, built using **Next.js 15+**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Shadcn/ui**, and **Redux Toolkit**.

This CMS provides a modern, responsive, **dark/light mode integrated** interface for managing and showcasing projects, blogs, skills, services, resumes, testimonials, FAQs, and more — with **role-based access** via **AWS Cognito** (Super Admin, Admin, Author, Editor) and **real-time notifications** via **Socket.IO**.

**Design Inspiration:** Phoenix Admin Dashboard ([Demo](https://prium.github.io/phoenix/v1.24.0/index.html?theme-control=true&color-scheme=dark))

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Backend 100% Complete | 🚧 Frontend Ready to Build (Client directory created with Next.js 15)

| ------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFR001 | Performance     | Pages should load in under 2 seconds on a 4G connection. | Optimized lazy loading and image compression.                  |
| NFR002 | Security        | Follow OWASP best practices for frontend security.       | Prevent XSS, CSRF, and enforce HTTPS-only communication.       |
| NFR003 | Scalability     | Frontend should scale with multiple backend instances.   | Use API endpoints configured for load-balanced environments.   |
| NFR004 | Maintainability | Codebase should follow clean architecture.               | Component-based, reusable, modular code with TypeScript types. |
| NFR005 | Accessibility   | Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.                           | ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios.             |
| NFR006 | UX Consistency  | All CRUD modals and forms follow consistent design.      | Shared form components and consistent animations.              |
| NFR007 | Localization    | System should be ready for multi-language support.       | Store text labels in JSON for i18n readiness.                  |
| NFR008 | Responsiveness  | Support major devices and browsers.                      | Mobile-first layout and cross-browser testing.                 |
| NFR009 | Reliability     | Offline-first caching strategy for essential pages.      | Use Next.js caching and fallback pages.                        |

### **Socket.IO Client Implementation**

```typescript
// store/socket.ts
import { io, Socket } from 'socket.io-client';

let socket: Socket | null = null;

export const initializeSocket = (token: string) => {
  socket = io('http://localhost:5000', {
    auth: { token },
    reconnection: true,
    reconnectionAttempts: 5,
    reconnectionDelay: 1000,
  });

  socket.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Socket.IO connected');
    socket?.emit('join:admin'); // Join admin room
  });

  // Register event listeners
  socket.on('project:created', (data) => {
    store.dispatch(addProject(data));
    showToast('New project created');
  });

  socket.on('project:updated', (data) => {
    store.dispatch(updateProject(data));
    showToast('Project updated');
  });

  // ... more event listeners for all modules
};

export const disconnectSocket = () => {
  if (socket) {
    socket.disconnect();
    socket = null;
  }
};
```

### **AWS Cognito Authentication Setup**

```typescript
// lib/cognito.ts
import {
  CognitoUserPool,
  CognitoUser,
  AuthenticationDetails,
} from 'amazon-cognito-identity-js';

const poolData = {
  UserPoolId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID!,
  ClientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID!,
};

const userPool = new CognitoUserPool(poolData);

export const signUp = (email: string, password: string) => {
  // Sign up implementation
};

export const signIn = (email: string, password: string) => {
  // Sign in implementation, returns ID token (use IdToken from response)
};

export const forgotPassword = (email: string) => {
  // Forgot password implementation
};

export const resetPassword = (
  email: string,
  code: string,
  newPassword: string
) => {
  // Reset password implementation
};
```

### **API Service Layer**

```typescript
export const projectApi = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'projectApi',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/api/v1/projects',
    prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
      const token = getState().auth.token;
      if (token) headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
      return headers;
    },
